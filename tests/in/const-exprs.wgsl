// While WGSL allows local variables to be declared anywhere in the function,

// case they need to be turned into Naga `Store` statements executed at the
// point of the WGSL declaration.
//
// When a variable's initializer is a constant expression, however, it can be
// evaluated at any time. The WGSL front end thus renders locals with
// initializers that are constants as Naga locals with initializers. This test
// checks that Naga local variable initializers are only used when safe.
